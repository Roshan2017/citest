# This module is intended to support the higher level json_contract.* modules.
# To that end, the lookups populate PredicateResult objects rather than just
# returning values, so are heavier weight that would be otherwise.

# The observer module contains support for specifying observers and making
# observations onto a system to collect the data supporting verification.

# The verifier module provides support for verifying observations meet
